# GameTheory Project

Welcome to the Game Theory project! 
This repository contains implementations and analyses related to game theory based on Mathlib. Our group is working on more contributions on the formalization of gamtheory perfix. 
Below is a brief overview of the contents and setup instructions.

## Contents

- `GameTheory/Secondprice.lean`: Formalise some core concepts and results in auction theory. This includes definitions for first-price and second-price auctions, as well as several fundamental results and helping lemmas.
- `GameTheory/Zerosum.lean`: The complete proof of  von Neumann's minimax theorem about zero-sum games.

## Current plan for formalization of Game Theory
The current plan for the formalizing of Game Theory include:

#### 1. Auction Theory. ðŸŽ‰   _(200+ lines, PR)_ [link](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/13248)
- Essential definitions of Sealed-bid auction, First-price auction and Second-price auction.
- First-price auction has no dominant strategy.
- Second-price auction has dominant strategy. (Second-price auction is DSIC)
- [x] _Will depend on #14163 once that PR is merged. The Fintype lemmas introduced by this PR have been added in that PR and will be removed from here once that PR gets merged_

#### 2. Mechanism design & Myerson's Lemma.    ðŸŽ‰ _(400+ lines, pending for modification to Mathlib Standard)_
-  Mechanism design
An allocation rule is implementable if there exists 
        - Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible (DSIC) payment rule
        - An allocation rule is monotone if for every bidderâ€™s gain is nondecreasing w.r.t. her/his bid
- Myerson's Lemma
                Implementable â‡” Monotone
                In the above case, the DSIC payment rule is unique.
                                      
#### 3. von Neumannâ€˜s Minimax Theorem. ðŸŽ‰ _(800+ lines, pending for modification to Mathlib Standard)_
- Equilibrium in zero sum game
- Formalization strategy: via Loomisâ€™s theorem.
#### 4. Nash Equilibrium. ðŸŽ‰ _(pending for modification to Mathlib Standard)_
    
#### 5. Brouwer fixed-point theorem. _(Work in Progress)_

#### 6. More Mechanism design._(Planning)_
